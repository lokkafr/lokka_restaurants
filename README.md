# lokka_restaurants
An all-in-one restaurant manager built for ox_core.
## Dependencies
- [ox_core](https://github.com/overextended/ox_core/)
- [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/)
- [ox_target](https://github.com/overextended/ox_target/)
## Stashes
This resource will not be handling stashes as that system has already been created by the OverExtended team in **ox_inventory** and re-inventing the wheel would be pointless.
