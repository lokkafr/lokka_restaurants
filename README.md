## Mapping Configs
For a simple way to handle people sharing maps, you can create a new issue with the mapping template. I will review the templates and, once they follow the format and are good to go, will be closed so others can view it.

## Crafting
I currently have an open draft pull request for ox_inventory that makes the crafting with this script work dynamically with the already pre-built systems. By default, crafting is disabled in this script, but can be enabled through `config/general.lua`. If you enable it, you will need to port the changes over from [this pull request](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory/pull/1830) into your ox_inventory.

Once (if) they merge my PR, this step will be removed. Until then, GLHF. You will want to follow the same exact table structure as ox_inventory when adding crafting tables into `config/jobs.lua`. Don't worry about defining the job name as I automatically inject it into the table structure for you.
